Hi!

I'm Berry, environmental scientist by training and R enthusiast by heart. 
I'm based in Potsdam near Berlin, Germany.   
I give [R courses](https://github.com/brry/course#slides), 
develop [rdwd](https://github.com/brry/rdwd#rdwd) and other [packages](ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/web/checks/check_results_berry-b_at_gmx.de.html), 
co-organize the [Berlin R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Berlin-R-Users-Group/) 
and help people with data analysis projects.  
Starting September, I plan to be a (freelance) R trainer and consultant. 
Please feel free to already [contact me](mailto:berry-b@gmx.de) for work requests or job offerings.  
My fields of expertise are:  

- data analysis & visualisation
- introductionary R courses
- package development
- spatio-temporal data analysis
- extreme value statistics
