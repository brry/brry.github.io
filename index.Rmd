Hi!

I'm Berry, environmental scientist by training and R enthusiast by heart.  
I give [R courses](https://github.com/brry/course#slides), develop [rdwd](https://github.com/brry/rdwd#rdwd) and other [packages](ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/web/checks/check_results_berry-b_at_gmx.de.html) and consult data analysis projects.  
Starting September, I plan to be a freelance R trainer and consultant.  
Please feel free to already [contact me](berry-b@gmx.de) for work requests.  
My fields of expertise are:  

- data analysis & visualisation
- introductionary R courses
- package development
- spatio-temporal data analysis
